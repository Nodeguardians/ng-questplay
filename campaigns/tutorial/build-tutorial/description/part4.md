# Submitting a Quest

> _You have casted a basic fireball. Now, throw it towards the dummy target._

Once local tests have passed, you are ready to publish your work for submission.

1. Push your work to your forked repo on Github. If you like, you can separate your changes into multiple commits, or batch them up into a single commit. 

2. Name your last commit's message as "`#{NAME_OF_QUEST}`". In this case, it will be "`#build-tutorial`". 

    The hashtagged message will prompt the NG Validation application on Github to send your work for submission!

3. Click "Verify" on **this page** to confirm that your work has been submitted.
