## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q:** Can I push my work onto a secondary branch in the repository?

**A:** Yes, the backend verification system will test your work on any branch so long as the commit message is tagged `#{QUEST_NAME}`.

**Q:** Do I have to submit my code for each section in a quest?

**A:** No, that would be inconvenient. You only need to submit your work at the **end of the quest**. Through the middle sections, you only need to run local tests to make sure you are on the right track.
